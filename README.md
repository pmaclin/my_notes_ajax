# My Notes Ajax

In the project, we'll learn how to implement Ajax on top of a standard CRUD application.

## Part 1:

 1. Add a functional form for a new note to the top of the notes index page.
 2. After adding a note, redirect the user to the notes index page rather than the notes show page.
 3. Order the notes index from newest to oldest.
 4. (optional) Connect Bootstrap and make it look less horrible.
